\arguments{
\item{gene}{gene id for the gene to run}

\item{chr}{chromosome where the gene is, example chr=22}

\item{snps}{either cis-window or character vector with pos:ref:alt allele for each snp, defaults to cis-window}

\item{counts.f}{path to files with filtered counts: rows genes, first col gene_id followed by samples, prepared in inputs.R}

\item{covariates}{path to matrixes of covariates prepared in inputs.R. If using gc correction (each gene diffrent value), the matrix has rownames= genes and cols=samples plus extra columns if other covariates are added. If only using lib size or gene independent covariates, rows are samples and columns are covariates. If no covariates, covariates =1, default}

\item{additional_cov}{full name to file with first column sample names and additional columns gene independent covariates, defaults to NULL}

\item{e.snps}{path to file listing exonic snps for the chromosome where the gene is, prepared in input.R}

\item{u.esnps}{whether to use unique exonic snps per gene, defaults to NULL when it is not necessary if strand info is known}

\item{gene.coord}{path to file listing gene coordinates and exons, prepared in input.R}

\item{vcf}{path to vcfs file with ASE and GT for the exonic snps for the chromosome where the gene is}

\item{sample.file}{sample file for the reference panel (sample description), to be used if ex.fsnp test is required and populatios is not the whole reference panel}

\item{le.file}{path to gz legend file (legend.gz) for the chromosome of interest for the reference panel (snp description)}

\item{h.file}{path to gz haplotpe file for the chromosome of interest for the reference panel (haplotypes for all samples in reference panel)}

\item{population}{ethnicity to set a cut-off for maf: AFR AMR EAS EUR SAS ALL, defaults to EUR}

\item{maf}{cut-off for maf, defaults to 0.05}

\item{min.ase}{minimun number of ASE counts for an individual in order to be included, defaults to 5}

\item{min.ase.snp}{minum number of ASE counts for a single snp to be considered, for a particular individual}

\item{min.ase.n}{minimun number individuals with the minimun of ASE counts, defaults to 5.}

\item{tag.threshold}{numeric with r2 threshold (0-1) for grouping snps to reduce the number of running tests, to disable use "no"}

\item{info}{numeric cut-off for var(E(G))/var(G), var(E(G)) is the expected variance for input and var(G) for reference panel, similar to info score in impute2, defaults to 0.3. rsnps with lower info wont be run by stan.}

\item{out}{path to save outputs, default to current}

\item{prefix}{optional prefix for saving files, if NULL gene_id will be used}

\item{prior}{named list: mean= vector with the mean of Gaussians, sd= vector with Gaussians sd for eQTL effect prior, mix=vector with mixing proportions. Defaults to NULL, mixture of 3 components with mean (0,0,0) ;sd  c( 0.0436992,  0.3492696, 0.4920049); and mixing proportions  c(0.9478807,0.05142192, 0.0006974015).}

\item{ex.fsnp, }{if character: vector with pos:ref:alt for fsnps to exclude, if numeric  p-value cut-off for fSNPs to exclude,  if  NULL none of the fsnps is excluded. Defaults to 0.01.}

\item{prob}{number pâˆˆ(0,1) indicating the desired probability mass to include in the intervals, defaults includes 0.99 and 0.95}

\item{AI_estimate}{full name to data table with AI estimates for reference panel bias for fSNPs, defaults to NULL}

\item{pretotalReads}{numeric indicating a cut-off for total initial reads to consider AI estimates, defaults to 100}

\item{skin}{character vector with the 2 Tissues to study}

\item{fishjoint}{whether to run Fisher test jointly in all samples or by skin, defaults to joint. For QC purposes for comparing with 1T model set to NULL (by treatment)}
